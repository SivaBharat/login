      <p class="about-content">On-demand food delivery services have completely revolutionized the traditional way of delivering food. 

        In fact, during the Covid pandemic, people have ordered more food than ever before, which was a huge deal for business, as where at one side the pandemic was forcing people to shut their food businesses down — On-Demand food delivery on the other hand was acting as a silver lining for them.
        
        And now, on-demand food delivery apps are gradually changing the traditional way of eating.
        
        The on-demand food delivery apps are becoming increasingly popular among millennials due to their speed and convenience. This allows you to savor away your favorite foods, right from the comfort of your own home.
        
        This can be a win-win situation for both restaurants and aggregators as restaurant owners do not need extensive food delivery infrastructure. 
        
        So this is why now is the perfect time to develop a profitable on-demand delivery solution for your business. To do this, you can either hire the best-dedicated developers or outsource to a dedicated software development team.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2 class="about-heading">Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="about-content">As the name suggests, in this business model, one service provider serves the entire food chain. This means one party does everything from food preparation to delivery to the customer’s doorstep. 

        This business model is very different from the previous two and requires significant capital investment. Typically, this business model is chosen by popular restaurants that create takeaway and delivery apps to offer additional amenities to regular customers. This allows customers to order food from the comfort of their own homes, which further boosts sales. The most famous example would be Dominos Pizza.
        
        Then some entrepreneurs even hire ghosts or cloud kitchens to prepare food. Then you choose the cloud kitchen business model and deliver food to your customers under your own banner. However, in this case, the restaurant does not offer a meal opportunity. All you need to do is take the order on the platform and deliver the food to your customers.
